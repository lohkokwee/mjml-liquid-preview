# MJML + Liquid Preview

![](./public/og-image.png)

A web-based tool for previewing MJML email templates with Liquid templating support. This was inspired by the amazing [@zonghangoh](https://github.com/zonghangoh) for productivity when developing with MJML and Liquid at [Ascenda](https://www.ascenda.com/). I thought it might be useful to others, so I beautified it, added more features to aid developing with it and open-sourced it. If you find this helpful, do give it a star!
